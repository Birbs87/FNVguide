    <h3> Mr. House</h3>

          <h4>Robert Edwin House, the enigmatic owner of the <em>Lucky 38 </em> casino and your current employer. A face on a screen with an army of securitrons at his disposal who claims to have protected Vegas from some of the warheads when the bombs dropped over two centuries ago. There must be some truth to it, as the New Vegas Strip is one of the only cities left in America where the streets are lit up at night, a beacon of neon lights and vices.</h4>
          <h4>Mr. House wants New Vegas to be a free economic zone with no affiliations, but one where he holds all the cards and his Securitron army upholds the order. Still, there seems to be more to the man than meets the eye.</h4>

    <h3>New California Republic (NCR)</h3>
      <img src=https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Fallout-New-Vegas-NCR-Ranger-And-Flag.jpg >
      <div class="justify">
    <h4>A federal republic to the West of Vegas, the NCR emulates the structure and values of Pre-War USA - democracy, liberty, and imperialist expansionism. Currently it has some presence in the region, but its resources are stretched thin as its army fails to keep up with the military campaigns.</h4>
    <h4>While the citizens in its borders are granted civil rights and legal protection, many find the system to be corrupt and ineffective. The NCR is also the greatest economic power in the Post-War world, proof that it is possible for a major society to be rebuilt in the ashes of the Old World.</h4>

    <h3>Caesar's Legion</h3>
      <img src=https://static1.thegamerimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Fallout-New-Vegas-Caesar-And-Lanius-Cropped.jpg>
      <div class="justify">
    <h4>
       A totalitarian dictatorship modeled after the Roman Empire. Founded and led by a man called Caesar, this faction uses conquest and enslavement of tribes to strengthen its military and spread its influence. Following a strict hierarchy of power, the Legion enforces its laws through brutality and controls its people with an iron fist.
    </h4>
    <h4>Despite being relatively new, the group amassed a formidable army and controls a vast part of the American South. Its territiories are considered relatively safe for travelers and inhabitants due to the eradication of raider tribes. By conquering the NCR and integrating its technology and economic might with their own military power, the Legion strives to create a totalitarian empire in the wasteland.</h4>

    <h3>Yes Man (aka "None Of The Above")</h3>
      <img src=https://images.fallout.wiki/e/e5/FNV_Character_Yes_Man.png>
      <div class="justify">
          <h4>If you want something done right, you do it yourself. Which apparently includes running New Vegas. Snooping around Benny's room uncovers Yes Man, a robot he hijacked and wanted to usurp Mr.House with. Yes Man is, as his name suggest, a yes-man, and completely unable to disagree with you, meaning he will be fully on board with your plans of letting New Vegas govern itself.</h4>
          <h4>(And since he can't disagree with you, Yes Man functions as a failsafe in case you burn bridges with the other three.)</h4>
