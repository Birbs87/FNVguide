          <h4>If you want something done right, you do it yourself. Which apparently includes running New Vegas. Snooping around Benny's room uncovers Yes Man, a robot he hijacked and wanted to usurp Mr.House with. Yes Man is, as his name suggest, a yes-man, and completely unable to disagree with you, meaning he will be fully on board with your plans of letting New Vegas govern itself.</h4>
          <h4>(And since he can't disagree with you, Yes Man functions as a failsafe in case you burn bridges with the other three.)</h4>
