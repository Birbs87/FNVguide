<h2>So, what's it about?</h2>
<div class="justify">
    <h4>If you don't know what the Fallout games are about, the gist is that the world ended in nuclear armageddon some 200 years back and now everywhere is a lawless post-apocalypse full of mutants. Also there's robots and laser pistols because retrofuturism. </h4>
    <h4>And now that you're all caught up:</h4>
    <br>
<h3>The opening cutscene starts and a man in a chekered suit monologues at you before shooting you in the head with a 9mm pistol.</h3>

<h2>You're dead. Great.</h2>
<br>
<div class="justify">
<h4>...except, plot twist, he is a terrible shot, because you wake up in a doctor's house sometime later. A robot cowboy (surprisingly not the only one in the game) dug you out of your shallow grave and dragged you in to get patched up. So after getting checked by the doctor for brain damage from the involuntary injection of a half an ounce of lead directly into the brain, you're free to go out into the wasteland.</h4>
<h4>Granted, you do have <em>some</em> brain damage from this little adventure, as the only thing you remember is your name, that you were a courier for the Mojave Express, and that the man who shot you stole the platinum poker chip you were delivering.</h4>
<h4>So, out into the wasteland you go. With the blinding sun in your eyes (and like 10 different pop-ups on your screen from all the dlcs), a good tune on the radio, and one single goal in mind: tracking the guy in a checkered suit and getting back your delivery. And as it turns out, it is one very important poker chip, one that may change the fate of the Mojave. </h4>

<h2>Now Entering: Spoiler Territory</h2>

<div class="spoiler-content" id='1'>
    <div class="justify">
    <h4>So, the chip is actually the key to activating a robot army and the robot cowboy who dug you out of your shallow grave was sent by your employer, Mr. House. Same Mr. House who made the Platinum chip and practically runs the city of New Vegas. The man who shot you, Benny, is one of his subordinates who planned on usurping him. And now Mr. House wants you to activate said robot army.</h4>
    <h4>You with me so far? It gets more convoluted.</h4>
    <h4>The robot army is stored in a bunker. A bunker under the Legion's encampment on the other side of the Colorado River. What's the Legion? A group of militarised imperialist fascists loosely modeled on the Roman Empire who want to conquer New Vegas. Meanwhile to the West we have the New California Republic, a somewhat democratic nation and the Legion's greatest enemy (more on both of them over at <a href=gameplay.html>"Factions"</a>).</h4>

    <h4>Both groups want to have complete control over New Vegas, Mr. House wants both of them out of his city, and you're just a mailman stuck in the middle of this mess. Still, your actions shall decide the fate of the Mojave. Will you let the NCR bring democracy to the wasteland, let the Legion maintain order with an iron fist, or let Mr. House's free market dictate the rules?</h4>

    <h4>Or maybe you will choose the fourth option: <em>None of the above</em>? After all, why not use the robot army to usurp power for yourself?</h4>
